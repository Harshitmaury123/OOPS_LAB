// Experiment 2. The monthly telephone bill is to be computed as follows:
//  Minimum Rs. 200 for upto 100 calls
//  Plus Rs. 0.60 per call for next 50 calls
//  Plus Rs. 0.50 per call for next 50 calls
//  Plus Rs. 0.40 per call for any call beyond 200 calls.
// The input contains name of the customer and number of calls made and the desired output is the name 
// and telephone bill to be paid by the customer.
// Create a class to represent an employee. It should include the following:
//  Data Members:
//  Name 
//  Number of calls
//  Bill amount
//  Member Functions:
//  To input data
//  To compute bill
//  To output the desired information
// Using this class, write a program to accomplish the intended task
